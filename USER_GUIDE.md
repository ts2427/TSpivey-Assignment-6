### 3. Statistical Analysis

**Purpose:** View key statistical findings from exploratory data analysis.

#### Correlation Analysis

**What It Shows:**
- Relationship between total affected and residents affected
- Pearson (linear) vs Spearman (monotonic) correlation

**How to Interpret:**
- **Pearson r=0.315** - Moderate linear relationship
- **Spearman œÅ=0.517** - Stronger rank-order relationship
- **Key Finding:** Non-linear pattern with outliers

**Why It Matters:**
- Helps predict state-level impact from total numbers
- Identifies when breaches disproportionately affect certain states

#### Chi-Squared Test

**What It Shows:**
- Whether organization type and breach type are related
- Statistical significance testing

**How to Interpret:**
- **œá¬≤=5,069.93** - Very large test statistic
- **p<0.001** - Highly statistically significant
- **Result:** Strong evidence that different industries face different threats

**Why It Matters:**
- Justifies industry-specific security strategies
- Validates tailored recommendations

**Using the Heatmap:**
- Darker colors = more breaches
- Look for patterns across rows/columns
- Identify your industry's vulnerabilities

#### ANOVA Results

**What It Shows:**
- Whether breach impact differs by organization type
- Comparison across multiple groups

**How to Interpret:**
- **F=2.65, p=0.010** - Statistically significant
- **Box Plot** - Shows distribution for each industry
- **Key Finding:** Healthcare and financial have different risk profiles

**Why It Matters:**
- Helps set realistic expectations by industry
- Informs budget allocation decisions

#### Descriptive Statistics Table

### 4. ML Predictions

**Purpose:** Predict whether a potential breach will be severe (>10,000 affected).

#### Model Performance

Review the metrics to understand model reliability:
- **Accuracy: 87.0%** - Correct 87% of the time
- **Precision: 63.3%** - Of predicted severe, 63% are actually severe
- **Recall: 83.0%** - Catches 83% of all severe breaches
- **F1 Score: 0.718** - Balanced performance measure

**What This Means:**
- Model is reliable for most predictions
- Some false alarms (37% of severe predictions)
- Rarely misses actual severe breaches (17%)

**Step 3: Select Breach Date**
Use date picker to choose when breach occurred/will occur.

**Step 4: Click "Predict Severity"**

#### Understanding Prediction Results

**Severity Probability:**
- 0-30%: Low risk
- 30-70%: Medium risk
- 70-100%: High risk

**Classification:**

#### Feature Importance

Shows which factors most influence predictions:
- **breach_type_HACK** - Hacking attacks (most important)
- **organization_type_MED** - Healthcare industry
- **breach_year** - Temporal trends
- etc.

**Why This Matters:**
- Understand what drives severe breaches
- Focus mitigation efforts on high-importance factors

## Interpreting Results

### Statistical Significance

**P-Value Interpretation:**
- p < 0.001: Highly significant (very strong evidence)
- p < 0.01: Significant (strong evidence)
- p < 0.05: Significant (sufficient evidence)
- p ‚â• 0.05: Not significant (insufficient evidence)

**When p < 0.05:**
- Results unlikely due to chance
- Relationship/difference is real
- Can act on findings with confidence

### Confidence in Predictions

**High Confidence:**
- ML probability: 0-30% or 70-100%
- Clear classification
- Consistent with feature importance

**Medium Confidence:**
- ML probability: 30-70%
- Near decision boundary
- Consider additional factors

**When to Be Cautious:**
- Unusual combinations (rare org type + rare breach type)
- Very recent dates (less historical data)
- Extreme impact numbers (>500K individuals)

### Using Multiple Sources

**Best Practice:**
1. Check Data Explorer for historical patterns
2. Review Statistical Analysis for relationships
3. Run ML Prediction for specific scenario
4. Generate Risk Assessment for recommendations

**Triangulate findings across all sections.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How often is the data updated?**
A: The current dataset includes breaches through June 2025. The database can be refreshed by re-running the ETL pipeline with updated source data.

**Q: Can I export data?**
A: Yes! Use the Download button on the Data Explorer page to export filtered data as CSV.

**Q: Does the dashboard require internet?**
A: No. Once loaded, the dashboard runs entirely offline (except initial page load).

**Q: Can I use this on mobile?**
A: The dashboard is optimized for desktop/laptop. Mobile viewing is possible but not recommended due to complex visualizations.

### Data Questions

**Q: What does "UNKN" breach type mean?**
A: Unknown breach types were filtered out during data cleaning (Assignment 4). The analysis only includes classified breaches.

**Q: Why are some "total_affected" values N/A?**
A: Not all breach notifications include impact numbers. This represents ~40% of records.

**Q: What's the difference between total_affected and residents_affected?**
A: total_affected = all individuals impacted nationwide/globally. residents_affected = only individuals in the reporting state.

**Q: Are these all U.S. breaches?**
A: Yes. Data source (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse) tracks breaches reported to U.S. government agencies.

### Prediction Questions

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: The Random Forest model achieves 87% overall accuracy with 83% recall for severe breaches.

**Q: Can I trust a "severe" prediction?**
A: 63% of severe predictions are correct (precision). Use as one input for decision-making, not the only factor.

**Q: What if my organization type isn't listed?**
A: Choose the closest match:
  - Tech company ‚Üí BSO
  - Healthcare-adjacent ‚Üí MED
  - Financial services ‚Üí BSF

**Q: Can I predict breaches more than 1 year out?**
A: The model is trained on historical data through 2025. Predictions far into the future become less reliable as threat landscape evolves.

### Risk Assessment Questions

**Q: Are cost estimates accurate?**
A: Costs are based on 2024 industry averages (Ponemon Institute). Actual costs vary by organization size, industry, and breach specifics.

**Q: Should I follow all recommendations?**
A: Recommendations are prioritized (üî¥ CRITICAL first). Implement based on your risk tolerance and budget.

**Q: How do I know what security budget is right?**
A: Use the recommended % range as a starting point, then adjust based on:
  - Your risk appetite
  - Regulatory requirements
  - Recent breach activity in your industry
  - Available resources

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Load

**Problem:** Blank page or loading spinner forever

**Solutions:**
1. Check that `databreach.db` exists in the project folder
2. Verify Streamlit is running (check terminal for errors)
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
5. Restart Streamlit: Ctrl+C, then `streamlit run app.py`

### Visualizations Not Appearing

**Problem:** Charts show as blank or error messages

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure Plotly is installed: `pip install plotly`
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
3. Try zooming out (Ctrl + minus key)
4. Disable browser extensions that block scripts

### Filters Not Working

**Problem:** Selecting filters doesn't change the data

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're on the Data Explorer page (not Statistical Analysis)
2. Check that filtered data count > 0
3. Refresh page (F5) to reset filters
4. Try broader filter combinations

### Predictions Fail

**Problem:** Error when clicking "Predict Severity"

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure all three inputs are selected (org type, breach type, date)
2. Check date is within reasonable range (2003-2030)
3. Restart Streamlit if model failed to load

### Slow Performance

**Problem:** Dashboard is laggy or unresponsive

**Solutions:**
1. Close other browser tabs
2. Reduce filter complexity (fewer simultaneous filters)
3. On Data Explorer, use narrower date ranges
4. Restart Docker container if using Docker

### Data Doesn't Match Documentation

**Problem:** Numbers don't align with Assignment 5 findings

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're using the correct `databreach.db` file
2. Check that data cleaning removed UNKN breach types
3. Ensure database has 35,378 records (run `get_table_info()`)
4. Re-run ETL pipeline if database is corrupted
