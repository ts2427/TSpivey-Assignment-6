## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Class Imbalance Challenge

**Observation:** Dataset is highly imbalanced (87.5% non-severe)
- This is realistic - most breaches affect fewer people
- Causes models to predict "non-severe" frequently
- Results in low recall (3.5%)

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Lower threshold (from 1,000 to 500 individuals)
- Apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
- Use class weighting in models
- Adjust decision threshold for higher recall

### 2. Feature Importance Insights

**Temporal features dominate** (51% combined importance)
- Breach patterns change over time
- Seasonal and weekly cycles exist
- Year-over-year trends significant

**Industry matters** (Healthcare = 11.2% importance)
- Aligns with Assignment 5 EDA findings
- Healthcare has highest breach risk
- Financial and retail also elevated

### 3. Business Recommendations

**For Healthcare Organizations:**
- Strengthen access controls (43% excess DISC breaches)
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Mandatory staff training on data handling

**For Financial Organizations:**
- Enhanced physical document security (169% excess PHYS)
- Secure shredding protocols
- Transition to digital-first document management

**For Retail Organizations:**
- Harden POS systems (400% excess CARD breaches)
- Accelerate EMV chip adoption
- End-to-end encryption for payments

- Imports `DataLoader` from `eda_package`
- Feature selection based on statistical findings:
  - Organization type: ANOVA p=0.010
  - Breach type: Chi-squared p<0.001
  - Temporal patterns: Time series analysis
- Leverages correlation and ANOVA insights

**Result:** All assignments work together as a unified analytics system.

## Production Deployment

### Model Serialization

Trained models are saved with complete metadata:
```python
# Load production model
from analytics_engine import BreachPredictor

predictor = BreachPredictor()
predictor.load_model('models/random_forest_severity_classifier.pkl')

# Make prediction
risk_score = predictor.predict_severity(new_breach_data)
```

### API Integration (Future Work)

```python
@app.route('/predict/severity', methods=['POST'])
def predict_severity():
    data = request.json
    prediction = predictor.predict_severity(data)
    return jsonify({
        'severity_probability': float(prediction),
        'risk_level': classify_risk(prediction),
        'recommendations': generate_recommendations(prediction)
    })
```

## Known Limitations

### Data Limitations
- Historical data only (cannot predict new breach types)
- 40% missing impact data in some records
- U.S. geographic scope only
- Reporting bias (only disclosed breaches)

### Model Limitations
- Binary classification (severe vs non-severe)
- Point-in-time predictions
- No causal inference
- Requires periodic retraining

### Business Limitations
- Cost estimates based on industry averages
- ROI depends on intervention effectiveness
- Cannot predict unknown attack vectors
- Performance may vary by organization size
